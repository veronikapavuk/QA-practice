# 🧩 QA Practice — Test Assignment

This repository contains my **QA trainee test assignment**.  
The project includes a testing checklist, a test case, bug reports, and a translated English version.  
It demonstrates my ability to analyze functionality, write structured test documentation, and identify UI/UX defects.
